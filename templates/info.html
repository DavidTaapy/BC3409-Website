        <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops when melanocytes (the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color) start to grow out of control. Cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can then spread to other areas of the body.</p>
        <p>Melanoma is <b>much less common</b> than some other types of skin cancers. But melanoma is <b>more dangerous</b> because itâ€™s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.</p>
        <p>Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites. Having darkly pigmented skin lowers your risk of melanoma at these more common sites, but anyone can get melanoma on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Melanomas in these areas make up a much larger portion of melanomas in African Americans than in whites.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <h5>The "ABCDE" Rule</h5>
            <p><li><b>Asymmetry</b>: The shape of one-half of the mole does not match the other.</li>
            <li><b>Border</b>: The edges are ragged, notched, uneven, or blurred.</li>
            <li><b>Colour</b>: Typically, they present themselves as brown or black tumours. However, some melanomas do not make melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white.</li>
            <li><b>Diameter</b>: Usually larger than 6mm, about the size of a pencil eraser. Melanoma may be smaller when it is first detected.</li>
            <li><b>Evolving</b>: Change in size, shape, color, or appearance, or it is growing in an area of previously normal skin. Also, when melanoma develops in an existing mole, the texture of the mole may change and become hard or lumpy. The skin lesion may feel different and may itch, ooze, or bleed</li>
            </p>
            Melanoma skin lesions typically do not cause pain.

              <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
              <p>Doctors will usually perform a biopsy and pathological examination of the skin legion. A skinand lyph node examination may also be done, along with an ultrasound scan and MRI.</p>

        <p>Nevus (plural: nevi) is the medical term for a mole. Nevi are typically harmless.
            In particular, dysplastic nevi often resemble melanoma.</p>

        <strong>Dysplastic nevus is benign (not cancerous). However, it is still advised to see a doctor as people with dysplastic nevus have a higher chance of developing melanoma.</strong>

          A seborrheic keratosis is a common noncancerous (benign) skin growth. People tend to get more of them as they get older.
          Seborrheic keratosis is harmless and not contagious. Thus, they typically do not need treatment.
