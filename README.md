# BC3409-Melanoma-Chatbot

## Description
The following contains the code for a web application that processes an image uploaded by the user, and returns whether the image contains one of the following kinds of skin conditions:
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Keratoses

## Models
The models used to analyse the images include RESNET, decision tree and random forest! The main focus of the AI model was set such that we have an accuracy for melanoma (skin cancer) of close to 100% as it is extremely costly if we predicted a false negative as it can result in late treatment!
